# live-stt — deferral queue

The funding menu, read on demand. Unattached ⇒ `.agent/spec.md` stays the sole attached state, and
its `Tasks` = one open `- [ ]` row per row below, same rank and title, then the pointer here. Rank =
funding order. Acceptance is written at deferral time while the evidence is fresh, and the funded row
is that unit's whole contract (`assurance-posture.md`). The session body the user pastes names the
rows it funds, and a `maintain.md` Queue body naming none funds every row in rank order; closing a
row deletes it from this file and from `.agent/spec.md`'s `Tasks` in one
commit. `tests/test_law_consistency.py` locks that pairing and rejects naming a row by `rank N`
anywhere else, since a rank retargets onto a different unit the moment an earlier row dies.

1. **Live-mic validation pass** — user-only (L-004), the largest untested surface: M13.2, the four
   2026-09-06 polish fixes and M14's `_respawn` arm have never met a mic (`_probe` has); standing
   debt = latency feel, `-o`, soak, sustained cadence, Ctrl+C-mid-decode, VAC partial cadence.
   **Accept:** the user runs `live-smoke.md` and reports; each item lands verified or defective.

2. **Reconcile the human-facing doc set** — `.agent/spec.md` `Artifacts` and `orientation.md` call
   `README.md` the only human-facing doc, while `human-docs.md`, L-021's owner, names `README.md`,
   `models/README.md` and the CLI strings ⇒ an agent reading the first two can write
   `models/README.md` in agent register. Docs tier.
   **Accept:** `rg -n --hidden 'human-facing' .agent/spec.md .claude/rules/` → every hit names the
   same surface set as `human-docs.md` or points at it; the gate stays green.

3. **Opt-in session audio** — no live audio exists, so accuracy work can only score read-speech
   corpora, never the user's real meetings (user ruling: add it, off by default). Data tier.
   **Accept:** `--save-audio` writes every captured block, before the queue, to
   `transcripts/<start>.wav` (16 kHz mono int16, created on the first block, header valid after every
   write), whatever `-o`/`--no-save` say, and the flag off writes no WAV; a fake-mic `run_session`
   lock proves both and reddens with the write neutralized; `replay.py` reads the file; README states
   the flag, ~115 MB/h and consent; the gate stays green.
